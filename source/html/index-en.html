<h2>We participate in only healthy token development projects</h2>

<p>Currently, TGE (ICO) has a tendency to become a popularity vote rather than an investment. Many projects that do not have minimum viable products and are far from sales are raising tens of millions dollars with only a whitepaper. This doesn’t deserve to be called a regular business plan.</p>

<p>Nowadays, companies facing financial difficulties are choosing to conduct ICOs as a means to solely raise funds, leading the acceleration of failed projects in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Therefore, we concluded that it is our mission as a blockchain company builder that we should develop better tokens and distribute them into the blockchain ecosystem. We are willing to support the growth of a healthy token economy by developing tokens that can be exchanged for products and services. We will achieve this by collaborating with companies that have robust underlying assets and proven models of business.</p>
